# glTF-Transform-lod-script

This is a script to make LODs for an [glTF](https://registry.khronos.org/glTF/specs/2.0/glTF-2.0.html) asset with [`glTF-Transform`](https://gltf-transform.donmccurdy.com/).

This script is based on [this example script](https://gist.github.com/donmccurdy/2226332bb58980caebcd21fe7cbca029).

LODs are defined with [glTF `MSFT_lod` extension](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/main/extensions/2.0/Vendor/MSFT_lod/README.md).
